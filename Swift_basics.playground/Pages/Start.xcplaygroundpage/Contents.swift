 ## From Wikipedia
 > Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is
 > designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. It is built
 > with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6. On platforms other than Linux,[10] it uses the Objective-C
 > runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program
